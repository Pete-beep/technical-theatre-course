New Chat Starter: Technical Theatre Course (Stage Management Module)

Hi, Iâ€™ve been working on a Technical Theatre Course with you in another chat. Hereâ€™s the context we already established:

Repo is set up with skeleton folders (modules/, assets/, templates/, etc.).

We have an updated Style Guide v2 (style-guide.md) that defines:

### Lesson X: Title format inside modules.

Content / Examples / Notes sections per lesson.

Activities with Task and Deliverable.

Summary with 3â€“5 key truths.

We also have a quick reference checklist (style-checklist.md).

Module 01 (Introduction to Technical Theatre) is complete as a Hybrid Merge (Overview + Safety lessons).

The course outline is in 00-course-outline.md.

ðŸ‘‰ Now Iâ€™d like to build out Module 02: Stage Management (lessons 3â€“6 in the outline):

Lesson 3: The Role of the Stage Manager in Different Performance Types

Lesson 4: Pre-Production Tasks

Lesson 5: Managing Rehearsals

Lesson 6: Show Calls and Performance Management

Please generate a 02-stage-management.md that follows the style guide and matches this outline.
