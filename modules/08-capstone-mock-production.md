# Capstone: Mock Production

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, students will be able to:
- Apply knowledge from all prior modules to plan and execute a small-scale production.
- Collaborate across production roles (SM, LX, SD, crew) with effective communication.
- Create and use essential paperwork (cue sheets, run sheets, plots, schedules).
- Demonstrate safe backstage practice during rehearsals and performance.
- Reflect on process and identify areas for growth.

## 📖 Key Concepts
- **Integration of Disciplines**: Lighting, sound, set, costumes, and management come together in real time.  
- **Paperwork as a Tool**: Cue sheets, run sheets, plots, and schedules keep everyone aligned.  
- **Rehearsal Process**: Paper Tech → Dry Tech → Wet Tech → Dress → Performance.  
- **Safety & Professionalism**: Standard backstage protocols, headset etiquette, and show stop procedures.  
- **Collaboration & Feedback**: Respecting each role, working as a team, and learning from post-show notes.

## 📝 Lesson Content

### 1. Setting the Project
- Students form a mock production team.
- Roles assigned (SM, ASM, LX, SD, Deck Crew, FOH liaison).
- Source material: a short scene, one-act, or devised piece.

### 2. Pre-Production
- Read-through & concept discussion.  
- Paperwork prep: contact sheet, schedule, risk assessment.  
- Scenic layout, prop list, costume needs.  

### 3. Technical Planning
- Lighting plot + hookup.  
- Sound input list + patch.  
- Cue list drafted.  
- Run sheet drafted.  

### 4. Rehearsal Process
- **Paper Tech**: Cueing discussion on paper.  
- **Dry Tech**: Crew + operators only.  
- **Wet Tech**: Add performers.  
- **Dress Rehearsal**: Full run with costumes/props.  

### 5. Performance
- Operate show “for real.”  
- Stage Manager calls cues.  
- Crew executes shifts, LX/SD execute cues.  

### 6. Reflection
- Post-show debrief: What worked? What needs growth?  
- Written reflection (individual + team).
