# Module 08: Capstone: Mock Production

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, students will be able to:
- Apply knowledge from all prior modules to plan and execute a small-scale production.
- Collaborate across production roles (SM, LX, SD, crew) with effective communication.
- Create and use essential paperwork (cue sheets, run sheets, plots, schedules).
- Demonstrate safe backstage practice during rehearsals and performance.
- Reflect on process and identify areas for growth.

---

## 📖 Key Concepts
- **Integration of Disciplines**: Lighting, sound, set, costumes, and management come together in real time.  
- **Paperwork as a Tool**: Cue sheets, run sheets, plots, and schedules keep everyone aligned.  
- **Rehearsal Process**: Paper Tech → Dry Tech → Wet Tech → Dress → Performance.  
- **Safety & Professionalism**: Standard backstage protocols, headset etiquette, and show stop procedures.  
- **Collaboration & Feedback**: Respecting each role, working as a team, and learning from post-show notes.
