Prerequisites: Familiarity with performance structures from Modules 1–3.

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, students will be able to:

* Explain and diagram basic **signal flow** from source → console → processing → amplification → loudspeakers.
* Set **proper gain structure** from preamp to PA with headroom and minimal noise.
* Identify common **microphone types/polar patterns** and choose appropriate mics for voices, instruments, and SFX.
* Build an **input list, stage plot, and patch plan** and translate them into console channel layouts.
* Configure and operate **aux/monitor mixes**, **FX sends/returns**, and **subgroups/VCA/DCAs**.
* Use core processing: **HPF/LPF, EQ, compression, gates**, and **delay**—with intent.
* Deploy and operate **wireless RF mics** safely: frequency coordination basics, scanning, and antenna best‑practices.
* Create a simple **sound design** for a scene (ambience, SFX, music beds) and call/execute **sound cues** reliably.
* Troubleshoot typical issues using a **fast diagnostic flow** (no signal, feedback, hum/buzz, RF dropouts).
* Apply **safety** practices: hearing conservation, power distro, grounding, cable management.

## 📖 Key Concepts

* **Signal flow:** Source → DI/Preamp → Console → Processing → L/R (mains) + Aux (monitors) → Amps/DSP → Loudspeakers.
* **Gain structure:** Set input trim for ~‑18 dBFS (digital) or healthy VU on analog; faders near unity; avoid clipping anywhere.
* **Mic types/patterns:** Dynamic vs condenser; cardioid/super/hyper/omni/figure‑8; proximity effect; off‑axis rejection.
* **Polarity vs phase:** 0/180° polarity flip vs time‑offset phase; when/why to flip polarity.
* **DI boxes & impedance:** Active vs passive, ground lift; instrument → line level → mic level conversions.
* **Loudspeakers:** Mains, fills, subs; crossover points; delay alignment; coverage vs SPL.
* **Monitors:** Wedge vs IEM; pre‑ vs post‑fader sends; ring‑out technique.
* **Processing:** HPF first, subtractive EQ, gentle compression, gates with care, FX tastefully.
* **Playback & SFX:** Redundant playback, cue lists, safety fades; show control etiquette.
* **RF basics:** Legal bands, scanning, intermod spacing, antenna placement (diversity, line‑of‑sight), bodypack handling.
* **Power & safety:** Dedicated circuits, proper grounding, cable ramps, hearing protection (NRR), SPL awareness.

## 📝 Lesson Content

### 1) System Overview & Signal Flow

* Walk the physical chain and draw a block diagram for your venue.
* Identify balanced vs unbalanced, mic vs line level, and connector types (XLR, TRS, TS, Speakon, EtherCon).
* Lab: Trace one microphone from stage to speaker, label each device, and verify with a pink‑noise test.

### 2) Gain Structure & Console Fundamentals

* Preamp trim method: **PFL → speak/sing at show level → target healthy average, no red**.
* Faders at/near **0 dB (unity)** for most channels; mix on faders, not trims.
* Channel strip order: **HPF → EQ → Dynamics → Insert FX → Fader** (varies by console).
* Metering: Input, bus, and output—watch for any stage of overload.

### 3) Microphones, DIs & Source Technique

* Mic selection by source (dialogue, vocals, guitar cab, strings, percussion).
* Polar pattern & placement to maximize wanted signal and minimize bleed.
* DI use cases (keys, acoustic guitar, playback), pad & ground‑lift.

### 4) Mixing Music & Speech for Clarity

* **Speech first**: HPF 80–120 Hz; remove low‑mid mud (200–400 Hz); de‑ess if needed.
* **Music beds**: carve space with EQ; mind masking; ride vocals on VCA/DCA.
* Use **sends** for reverb/delay; keep returns controlled; mute on transitions.

### 5) Monitors & Feedback Control

* Pre‑fader aux for wedges/IEMs; build mixes from the stage performers’ needs.
* **Ring‑out**: slowly raise aux master, identify offending frequencies, notch with narrow EQ.
* Stagecraft: mic angles, wedge placement, and keeping mics behind PA coverage.

### 6) Wireless Microphones (RF)

* Site survey & scan; choose open spectrum; coordinate channels to avoid intermod.
* Antenna placement: elevated, clear line‑of‑sight, correct polarization; use distro and low‑loss coax as needed.
* Battery policy: fresh for each show; secure packs & cables; label and track.

### 7) Playback & Show Control

* Build a cue list (pre‑show → walk‑in → scene ambiences → transitions → curtain call).
* Redundancy: two playback devices on separate channels; standby/mute discipline.
* File prep: consistent levels, head/tail trims, and naming.

### 8) Paperwork & Prep

* Create **Input List**, **Patch Sheet**, **Stage Plot**, **RF Chart**, and **Run Sheet**.
* Console layout: channel order, color coding, DCAs/VCAs, mute groups.
* Pre‑show checklist and line‑check procedure.

### 9) Troubleshooting Flow (Fast)

1. **No signal?** Check source → cable → input → PFL meter → routing → mute groups → bus.
2. **Feedback?** Identify mic/bus, pull master 3 dB, notch frequency, reposition mic/wedge.
3. **Hum/buzz?** Lift grounds (DI), separate power & audio, check shared circuits.
4. **RF dropout?** Check antennas, batteries, distance, frequency conflicts, body blocking.

## 🎬 Activities / Labs

* **Lab A — Signal Path Hunt:** Teams trace and label a live mic path; submit a block diagram.
* **Lab B — Gain & EQ Workshop:** Set trims, apply HPF/EQ for 3 sources (speech, acoustic guitar, keys). Record before/after.
* **Lab C — Monitor Mix Build:** Create two wedge mixes and one IEM mix; demonstrate ring‑out technique.
* **Lab D — RF Mini‑Coord:** Run a scan, pick 4 clean frequencies, document antenna plan, and label packs.
* **Lab E — Cue Design:** Build a 10‑cue scene (ambience, stings, transitions) with a cue list and timing notes.

## 📝 Instructor Notes (optional)

* If your venue uses a specific console (e.g., A&H QU, Yamaha TF/QL/CL, or Behringer X32), drop in a one‑page **quick‑start** with screenshots.
* Consider a short **ear‑training** exercise: identify 200 Hz/400 Hz/2 kHz boosts and cuts on speech.
* If time permits, demo **time alignment** (mains → fills) with a simple measurement app and delay.
