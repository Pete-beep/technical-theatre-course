## üìù Lesson Content

### Lesson 1: Overview of Technical Theatre Across Performance Types

Technical theatre encompasses the behind-the-scenes work that turns artistic vision into an effective audience experience‚Äîwhether the event is a play, concert, dance recital, ceremony, or presentation. Lighting shapes focus and mood, sound provides clarity and impact, and stagecraft creates the physical world in which the story unfolds.

**Content**
- Definition and significance of technical theatre across plays, concerts, dance recitals, and presentations.  
- Key roles in technical theatre: Stage Manager, Lighting Designer/Operator, Sound Designer/Operator, Backstage Crew.  
- Differences in technical demands for each performance type.  
- Roles in different performance types.  

**Examples**
- Diagram: Technical team hierarchy.  
- Chart: Comparison of technical needs for musicals, plays, concerts, and recitals.  

**Notes**
- **Plays:** Subtle lighting and targeted sound effects support intimate storytelling.  
- **Concerts:** High-energy lighting and robust sound reinforcement match musical dynamics.  
- **Dance recitals:** Color, angle, and timing of light emphasize movement and costume detail.  
- **Presentations:** Clear amplification and projection ensure accessibility and engagement.

### Lesson 2: Safety in the Theatre and Performance Spaces

Safe practice is essential in every aspect of technical theatre. Safety protects the crew, the performers, and the audience, and ensures that creative work is not undermined by accidents.

**Content**
- Safety protocols for handling lighting, sound, and stage equipment.  
- Emergency procedures and risk assessments for performance spaces.  
- Proper use of safety gear: gloves, goggles, harnesses, and fire extinguishers.  

**Examples**
- **Safety Checklist:** A backstage safety protocol document.  
- **Risk Assessment Template:** A template for identifying potential hazards.

## üé¨ Activities / Exercises

### Activity A (Lesson 1): Compare Two Event Types (Small Groups)
**Task:** Choose a *play* and a *concert* (or *dance recital*). Draft a one-page tech plan outlining:  
- Top 3 lighting requirements and why.  
- Top 3 sound requirements and why.  
- Set/backstage implications (scene shifts, crew size).  
**Deliverable:** Present your plan; defend one trade-off decision (e.g., mic allocation vs. feedback risk).  

### Activity B (Lesson 1): Role Map for a School Play (Whole Class)
**Task:** List required technical roles, assign responsibilities, and identify handoffs (e.g., SM ‚Üî LX Op for cueing).  
**Deliverable:** A simple ‚Äútech org chart‚Äù with 8‚Äì12 roles and one sentence per responsibility.  

### Activity C (Lesson 2): Identify Safety Risks in a Stage Setup
**Task:** Review a mock stage setup (diagram or description). Identify at least 5 potential risks (trip hazards, electrical overload, rigging issues).  
**Deliverable:** Group list of identified risks and mitigation strategies.  

### Activity D (Lesson 2): Complete a Sample Risk Assessment
**Task:** Use a risk assessment template to evaluate a small theatre performance space.  
**Deliverable:** Completed risk assessment form highlighting hazards, risk levels, and mitigation measures.

## ‚úÖ Summary
- Technical theatre is the operational backbone of performance, translating creative ideas into reliable, safe, repeatable results.  
- Roles are interdependent; communication and well-timed cues make the show.  
- Different event types drive different technical priorities‚Äîplan accordingly.  
- Safety is a culture and a checklist; both matter every time.
