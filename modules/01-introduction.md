## **Module 1: Introduction to Technical Theatre (Week 1\)**

### **Definition and Significance of Technical Theatre**

Technical theatre encompasses all the behind-the-scenes work that makes a production possible. This includes lighting, sound, set design, props, costumes, and stage management. Whether it’s a play, concert, dance recital, or presentation, technical theatre ensures the performance is engaging, professional, and impactful.
