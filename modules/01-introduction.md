## üìñ Key Concepts
- **Technical Theatre** ‚Äî The backstage disciplines that realize a production (lighting, sound, sets, props, costumes, stage management, projections).
- **Production Roles** ‚Äî Stage Manager, Lighting/Sound Designer & Operator, Set/Costume Designer, Projection Designer, Technical Director, Backstage/Fly Crew.
- **Performance Types** ‚Äî Play, Musical, Concert, Dance Recital; each has distinct technical needs.
- **Collaboration** ‚Äî Communication, cueing, run sheets, checklists, teamwork.
- **Safety Protocols** ‚Äî PPE, risk assessment, emergency procedures.

## üìù Lesson Content

### Lesson 1: Overview of Technical Theatre Across Performance Types

Technical theatre encompasses the behind-the-scenes work that turns artistic vision into an effective audience experience‚Äîwhether the event is a play, concert, dance recital, ceremony, or presentation. Lighting shapes focus and mood, sound provides clarity and impact, and stagecraft creates the physical world in which the story unfolds.

#### Roles & Responsibilities (Backstage Ecosystem)
- **Stage Manager:** Coordinates the production; maintains prompt book; calls cues to synchronize lights, sound, and stage actions.
- **Lighting Designer / Operator:** Designs looks, plots and focuses fixtures, programs and executes cues on the console.
- **Sound Designer / Operator:** Designs the soundscape (music, effects, mics), manages gain structure, mixes for clarity and impact.
- **Set Designer / Carpentry:** Designs and builds scenery aligned to concept, ensures safe/feasible construction.
- **Costume Designer / Wardrobe:** Designs/sources costumes, manages fittings and quick changes.
- **Projection/Media Designer:** Prepares visual media (slides/video) and operates playback systems.
- **Technical Director (TD):** Oversees technical feasibility, safety, scheduling, and crew leadership.
- **Backstage Crew / Deck / Props:** Executes scene shifts, manages props and traffic backstage.
- **Fly Crew (where applicable):** Operates rigging/fly systems with strict safety and timing.

#### Technical Needs by Performance Type
| Performance Type | Lighting Needs            | Sound Needs                 | Set/Scenery         | Backstage Crew Size |
|------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Musical          | Dynamic, cue-dense looks  | Multiple wireless mics, band/orchestra mix | Often elaborate      | Large               |
| Play             | Subtle shifts, focus      | Spot effects, intelligibility | Minimal to moderate | Moderate            |
| Concert          | Time-coded or busked, high energy | Live reinforcement, feedback control | Minimal              | Moderate            |
| Dance Recital    | Color, side-light, timing | Clean music playback        | Minimal             | Small               |

**Notes**
- **Musicals:** Primary challenge is balancing many open mics with music while hitting precise lighting cues.
- **Concerts:** Priority is live audio quality and busked or time-coded lighting in sync with tempo.
- **Plays:** Detail and subtlety‚Äîeye lines, quiet scene changes, naturalistic effects.
- **Dance:** Visibility of movement; side light and wash quality are critical.

### Lesson 2: Safety in the Theatre and Performance Spaces

Safe practice is essential in every aspect of technical theatre. Safety protects the crew, the performers, and the audience, and ensures that creative work is not undermined by accidents.

#### Content
- Safety protocols for handling lighting, sound, and stage equipment.
- Emergency procedures and risk assessments for performance spaces.
- Proper use of safety gear: gloves, goggles, harnesses, and fire extinguishers.

#### Examples
- **Safety Checklist:** A backstage safety protocol document.
- **Risk Assessment Template:** A template for identifying potential hazards.

## üé¨ Activities / Exercises

### Activity A (Lesson 1): Compare Two Event Types (Small Groups)
**Task:** Choose a *play* and a *concert* (or *dance recital*). Draft a one-page tech plan outlining:
- Top 3 lighting requirements and why.
- Top 3 sound requirements and why.
- Set/backstage implications (scene shifts, crew size).
**Deliverable:** Present your plan; defend one trade-off decision (e.g., mic allocation vs. feedback risk).

### Activity B (Lesson 1): Role Map for a School Play (Whole Class)
**Task:** List required technical roles, assign responsibilities, and identify handoffs (e.g., SM ‚Üî LX Op for cueing).
**Deliverable:** A simple ‚Äútech org chart‚Äù with 8‚Äì12 roles and one sentence per responsibility.

### Activity C (Lesson 2): Identify Safety Risks in a Stage Setup
**Task:** Review a mock stage setup (diagram or description). Identify at least 5 potential risks (trip hazards, electrical overload, rigging issues).
**Deliverable:** Group list of identified risks and mitigation strategies.

### Activity D (Lesson 2): Complete a Sample Risk Assessment
**Task:** Use a risk assessment template to evaluate a small theatre performance space.
**Deliverable:** Completed risk assessment form highlighting hazards, risk levels, and mitigation measures.

## ‚úÖ Summary
- Technical theatre is the operational backbone of performance, translating creative ideas into reliable, safe, repeatable results.
- Roles are interdependent; communication and well-timed cues make the show.
- Different event types drive different technical priorities‚Äîplan accordingly.
- Safety is a culture and a checklist; both matter every time.
