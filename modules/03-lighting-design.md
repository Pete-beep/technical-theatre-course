# Module 03: Lighting Design

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, students will be able to:
1. Explain the role of lighting in storytelling (visibility, composition, mood, focus, rhythm).
2. Identify and safely set up common fixture types (conventional, LED, moving head) and accessories.
3. Read, interpret, and create a basic **lighting plot**, **channel hookup**, and **patch** for a small venue.
4. Program cue lists with fades, follow times, and part cues on an ETC-style console (concepts apply broadly).
5. Execute a **focus session** using standard calls and safe ladder/MEWP practice.
6. Collaborate with stage management and other departments using shared paperwork and cueing language.
7. Evaluate a lighting look using color theory, angle, and texture (gobos, diffusion) and iterate based on notes.

## 📖 Key Concepts
- **Functions of Light:** Visibility, Selective Focus, Modeling, Mood/Atmosphere, Time/Place, Rhythm.
- **Beam Geometry:** Field vs. beam angle, photometrics, throw distance, inverse-square law (practical shortcuts).
- **Fixture Families:** Par, Fresnel, Ellipsoidal/Profile (LEKO), Cyclorama/Wash, LED pars/batten, Moving head (spot/wash/profile).
- **Color:** Additive (RGB/HSI) vs subtractive (gel/CMY), color temperature (CCT), metamerism, CRI/TM-30 in practice.
- **Angle & Systems:** McCandless concept, front light, high-side, backlight, toplight, shinbusters, specials.
- **Control Path:** DMX512, opto-splitters, universes, addressing, personalities, sACN/Art-Net basics.
- **Paperwork:** Lighting plot, channel hookup, instrument schedule, patch sheet, focus chart, cue list.
- **Cueing:** State, transition, cue timing (up/down), follows, autofollows, cue parts, blockers, color bumps.
- **Safety:** Electrical basics, load paths, rigging points, ladders/MEWPs, cable management, PPE, “dead hung” vs. flown.
- **Collaboration:** Paper tech, dry tech, wet tech; SM call structure (Warnings/Standbys/Go).

## 📝 Lesson Content

### Lesson 7: 1) Light & Story (45–60 min)
- Watch short scene; discuss what the light communicates.
- Demonstrate how angle and color alter perception (front vs. back; cool vs. warm).
- Quick activity: “Find the Focus”—students adjust two systems to guide audience attention.

**Artifacts:** Reflection notes; 3-sentence justification for a chosen look.

---

### Lesson 8: 2) Instruments & Optics (60–75 min)
- Hands-on tour: Par, Fresnel, Ellipsoidal; LED vs. tungsten; moving heads.
- Photometrics in practice: choosing lens tubes (19°/26°/36°) for throw; beam calculator cheats.
- Accessories: barn doors, top hats, iris, gobo holder, diffusion/ND; safety cables and C-clamps.

**Mini-lab:** Hang one ellipsoidal, lamp (if applicable), rough focus, and safe tie-off.

---

### Lesson 9: 3) Power, Data & Patch (60–75 min)
- Power: circuits, dimmers vs. non-dim; distro etiquette; balancing loads.
- Data: DMX addressing, personalities, RDM; networked control (sACN) and universe planning.
- Patching on console: addressing vs. channeling; groups, palettes/presets.

**Checklist:** See “Lighting & Sound Pre-Use” in Appendix. Patch a 6-channel front system + 2 specials.

---

### Lesson 10: 4) Plotting & Paperwork (60–90 min)
- Reading a plot: title block, legend, unit numbers, purpose, focus area.
- Creating a mini-plot for a scene (provided ground plan). Keep to 12–18 units.
- Generate **channel hookup**, **instrument schedule**, and **patch sheet**.

**Deliverables:** PDF of plot + CSV hookup. File naming should follow **Documentation & File Naming Standards** (Appendix).

---

### Lesson 11: 5) Focus Session & Notation (60–90 min)
- Focus procedure: SM/board op calls; “Tilt… Pan… Sharpen… Soften… Shutter in on SR portal…”
- Record **focus charts** and purpose notes (why each unit exists).
- Safety emphasis: ladder foot, three points of contact, tool lanyards, clear floor calls.

**Skill check:** Students lead the focus of one area light and one special.

---

### Lesson 12: 6) Programming Cues (90 min)
- Building states: groups, intensity/focus/color palettes; using **Cue Only** vs **Track**.
- Timings: split up/down, follows, blockade cues, cue parts for multi-system transitions.
- Musical moment: time a 30–45s transition to music beats; discuss rhythm and breath.

**Assessment:** Program 8–12 cues for a short scene with at least one follow and one part cue.

---

### Lesson 13: 7) Tech & Notes (45–60 min)
- Paper tech etiquette; dry tech order; data backup routine.
- SM integration: how to request holds, how to offer alternatives.
- Notes workflow: “keep/adjust/rebuild” categories; photo references for looks.

**Exit task:** Submit a one-page **cue synopsis** (what the audience experiences per cue block).
