# Lighting Design

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, students will be able to:
1. Explain the role of lighting in storytelling (visibility, composition, mood, focus, rhythm).
2. Identify and safely set up common fixture types (conventional, LED, moving head) and accessories.
3. Read, interpret, and create a basic **lighting plot**, **channel hookup**, and **patch** for a small venue.
4. Program cue lists with fades, follow times, and part cues on an ETC-style console (concepts apply broadly).
5. Execute a **focus session** using standard calls and safe ladder/MEWP practice.
6. Collaborate with stage management and other departments using shared paperwork and cueing language.
7. Evaluate a lighting look using color theory, angle, and texture (gobos, diffusion) and iterate based on notes.

## 📖 Key Concepts
- **Functions of Light:** Visibility, Selective Focus, Modeling, Mood/Atmosphere, Time/Place, Rhythm.
- **Beam Geometry:** Field vs. beam angle, photometrics, throw distance, inverse-square law (practical shortcuts).
- **Fixture Families:** Par, Fresnel, Ellipsoidal/Profile (LEKO), Cyclorama/Wash, LED pars/batten, Moving head (spot/wash/profile).
- **Color:** Additive (RGB/HSI) vs subtractive (gel/CMY), color temperature (CCT), metamerism, CRI/TM-30 in practice.
- **Angle & Systems:** McCandless concept, front light, high-side, backlight, toplight, shinbusters, specials.
- **Control Path:** DMX512, opto-splitters, universes, addressing, personalities, sACN/Art-Net basics.
- **Paperwork:** Lighting plot, channel hookup, instrument schedule, patch sheet, focus chart, cue list.
- **Cueing:** State, transition, cue timing (up/down), follows, autofollows, cue parts, blockers, color bumps.
- **Safety:** Electrical basics, load paths, rigging points, ladders/MEWPs, cable management, PPE, “dead hung” vs. flown.
- **Collaboration:** Paper tech, dry tech, wet tech; SM call structure (Warnings/Standbys/Go).

> Vocabulary appears in the course **Glossary**; add new terms as needed.

## 📝 Lesson Content

### 1) Light & Story (45–60 min)
- Watch short scene; discuss what the light communicates.
- Demonstrate how angle and color alter perception (front vs. back; cool vs. warm).
- Quick activity: “Find the Focus”—students adjust two systems to guide audience attention.

**Artifacts:** Reflection notes; 3-sentence justification for a chosen look.

---

### 2) Instruments & Optics (60–75 min)
- Hands-on tour: Par, Fresnel, Ellipsoidal; LED vs. tungsten; moving heads.
- Photometrics in practice: choosing lens tubes (19°/26°/36°) for throw; beam calculator cheats.
- Accessories: barn doors, top hats, iris, gobo holder, diffusion/ND; safety cables and C-clamps.

**Mini-lab:** Hang one ellipsoidal, lamp (if applicable), rough focus, and safe tie-off.

---

### 3) Power, Data & Patch (60–75 min)
- Power: circuits, dimmers vs. non-dim; distro etiquette; balancing loads.
- Data: DMX addressing, personalities, RDM; networked control (sACN) and universe planning.
- Patching on console: addressing vs. channeling; groups, palettes/presets.

**Checklist:** See “Lighting & Sound Pre-Use” in Appendix. Patch a 6-channel front system + 2 specials.

---

### 4) Plotting & Paperwork (60–90 min)
- Reading a plot: title block, legend, unit numbers, purpose, focus area.
- Creating a mini-plot for a scene (provided ground plan). Keep to 12–18 units.
- Generate **channel hookup**, **instrument schedule**, and **patch sheet**.

**Deliverables:** PDF of plot + CSV hookup. File naming should follow **Documentation & File Naming Standards** (Appendix).

---

### 5) Focus Session & Notation (60–90 min)
- Focus procedure: SM/board op calls; “Tilt… Pan… Sharpen… Soften… Shutter in on SR portal…”
- Record **focus charts** and purpose notes (why each unit exists).
- Safety emphasis: ladder foot, three points of contact, tool lanyards, clear floor calls.

**Skill check:** Students lead the focus of one area light and one special.

---

### 6) Programming Cues (90 min)
- Building states: groups, intensity/focus/color palettes; using **Cue Only** vs **Track**.
- Timings: split up/down, follows, blockade cues, cue parts for multi-system transitions.
- Musical moment: time a 30–45s transition to music beats; discuss rhythm and breath.

**Assessment:** Program 8–12 cues for a short scene with at least one follow and one part cue.

---

### 7) Tech & Notes (45–60 min)
- Paper tech etiquette; dry tech order; data backup routine.
- SM integration: how to request holds, how to offer alternatives.
- Notes workflow: “keep/adjust/rebuild” categories; photo references for looks.

**Exit task:** Submit a one-page **cue synopsis** (what the audience experiences per cue block).

---

## 🎬 Activities / Exercises
- **Angle Lab:** In pairs, create three distinct looks using only angle changes; present before/after photos.
- **Color Storyboard:** Choose a scene; pick a 5-color palette (with CCT justification) and explain choices.
- **Focus Drill:** 5-minute timed focus of a special to a small prop; peers use the focus chart to verify.
- **Rhythm Exercise:** Align two transitions to the same musical excerpt, one “breath in,” one “breath out.”
- **Safety Walk:** Daily pre-use inspection using the Appendix checklist; report one improvement item.

---

## 🧪 Assessment & Rubrics
- **Practical (40%):** Hang/patch/focus competency; console programming demo.
- **Paperwork (30%):** Mini-plot, hookup, patch sheet, focus charts; clarity & adherence to standards.
- **Design Rationale (20%):** Short write-up linking angle/color/texture to story beats.
- **Professional Practice (10%):** Safety behavior, collaboration, and notes responsiveness.

Rubric highlights:
- Clarity of focus (what should the audience see?)
- Consistency of systems and color logic
- Safe, tidy, and repeatable practice (cable paths, labeling, backups)

---

## 🛡️ Safety
- **Electrical:** Never repurpose damaged cables; check connectors; lock-out/tag-out where applicable.
- **Rigging:** Always use safety cables; verify clamp and secondary retention; never stand under a load.
- **Access Equipment:** Ladder footing, three points of contact, MEWP certification where required.
- **Housekeeping:** Taped cables, no trip hazards, designated tool zones, dark-safe habits (headlamp red mode).

> Refer to Appendix: **PPE & Equipment Safety Guidelines**, **Backstage Daily Safety Walkthrough**, and **Electrical Safety Basics**.

---

## 📎 Paperwork & Templates (See Appendix)
- **Lighting Plot** (PDF) and **Channel Hookup** (CSV/Sheet).
- **Focus Charts** (per unit) and **Cue List**.
- **Pre-Use Checklist** and **Post-Show Reset**.
- **File Naming Standards** for all submissions.

## ✅ Summary
Lighting design shapes attention, mood, and rhythm. With a basic rig, thoughtful angles, and intentional color, students can craft clear, repeatable cues that serve story and safety. Mastery comes from clean paperwork, reliable patching, and responsive tech-note cycles.
