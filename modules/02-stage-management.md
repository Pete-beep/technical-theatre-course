# Module 02: Stage Management

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, students will be able to:

* Identify the core responsibilities of a Stage Manager (SM) across plays, musicals, dance, concerts, and devised work.
* Create a pre-production package: contact sheet, production calendar, preliminary rehearsal schedule, stage plot, and paperwork templates.
* Plan and run efficient rehearsals: blocking notation, line notes, rehearsal reports, and communication cadence.
* Prepare and execute show calls: cueing, standby stacks, comms discipline, and performance paperwork.
* Demonstrate professional standards for safety, communication, documentation, and leadership.

---

## 📖 Key Concepts

* The SM as hub for **communication**, **documentation**, and **coordination**
* Paperwork ecosystems: **who needs what, by when, and in what format**
* **Rehearsal flow**: objectives, timeboxing, and feedback loops
* **Calling a show**: translating designs into actionable cueing
* **Safety & consent**: intimacy, fight, FX, and emergency protocols
* **Stage Plot**: a central diagram showing the layout of scenery, props, actor positions, and technical gear; referenced by multiple departments throughout the production

---

## 📖 Key Terms (Quick Reference)

* **Cue:** Instruction to trigger a technical/performance action.
* **Standby:** Warning that a cue is imminent.
* **Go:** The command to execute the cue.
* **Blocking:** Recorded actor movement and positions.
* **Preset:** Placement of props, costumes, or set pieces before a scene begins.
* **Run Sheet:** Step-by-step tasks per crew role.
* **Show Report:** Post-show summary including times, incidents, and departmental notes.

## 📝 Lesson Content

### Lesson 3: The Role of the Stage Manager in Different Performance Types

**Content:**

* **Plays:** smaller cue counts, text-driven; emphasis on script, blocking, props tracking, line notes.
* **Musicals:** music and dance integration; increased cues, complex transitions, more departments (orchestra, audio, RF).
* **Dance/Movement:** choreographic structures over dialogue; cueing off counts, phrases, or conductor; floor pattern tracking.
* **Concerts/Events:** live timing with limited rehearsal; heavy comms, backline/patch logistics, safety around haze/pyro.
* **Devised/Fringe:** evolving scripts; flexible paperwork; rapid version control and daily change logs.
* **Throughlines:** safety leadership, clear comms tree, and decisive time management regardless of genre.

**Examples:**

* Sample **responsibility matrix** comparing Play vs Musical vs Dance (who owns what: props, quick-changes, spikes, mics).
* A one-page **Comms Map** (SM → ASM → Deck; SM ↔ FOH; SM ↔ Designers; SM ↔ Music Director).

**Notes:**

* When in doubt, **clarify cues’ sources** (visual, musical, conductor, deck-ready).
* Define **authority boundaries** early (e.g., stop authority for safety).

---

### Lesson 4: Pre-Production Tasks

**Content:**

* Confirm **production timeline**: auditions → build → tech → previews → run → strike.
* Build the SM **paperwork kit**:

  * Contact sheet, distribution list, pronouns/access needs (if collected).
  * Production calendar with **milestones** and blackout dates.
  * Rehearsal schedule template (objectives + locations + who’s called).
  * Preliminary **run sheets**, **props lists**, **scene breakdown**, **entrance/exit plots**.
  * **Stage Plot** showing layout of set pieces, props, spike marks, and technical elements (band gear, monitors, mic stands, quick-change zones).
  * Risk register (FX, flying, fog/haze, weaponry, intimacy/fight).
* **Information intake:** read-through notes, design packets, groundplan, score/script versions, mic plot, quick-change zones.
* **Meetings:** design/production meetings—capture decisions and action items, circulate minutes within 24 hours.

**Examples:**

* 3-week sample **production calendar** (color-coded departments).
* **Props tracker** (Item, Source, Status, Notes, Preset, Page).
* **Stage Plot** diagram with labels for entrances, exits, set pieces, and technical positions.
* **Version control**: file naming (`Show_Script_v03_2025-10-14.docx`).
* **Risk Register Matrix**: hazard, likelihood, mitigation, owner.

**Notes:**

* Lock a **single source of truth** (cloud folder naming + update etiquette). If it isn’t in the prompt book or SSoT, it isn’t official.
* Publish **distribution cadence** (e.g., daily rehearsal report by 10pm).
* Ensure the **Stage Plot** is updated as designs evolve; distribute revisions to all departments.
* Use discretion with personal data (pronouns/access needs) to respect privacy.

### Lesson 5: Managing Rehearsals

**Content:**

* **Room setup:** groundplan/spikes, first-aid, water, sign-in, silence zones, battery charging, RF etiquette.
* **Flow:** call time, warm-up, goals review, work blocks (50–80 min), breaks, wrap with next-day call.
* **Documentation:**

  * **Blocking notation** (symbols + actor initials + page references).
  * **Line notes** (omission/addition/paraphrase).
  * **Rehearsal report** (issues, requests, deadlines, safety notes).
  * **Change log** and distribution.
* **People & pacing:** balancing director’s needs with room morale; escalation path for concerns; consent practices for intimacy/fight.
* **Contingencies:** absent performers, tech delays, injury protocol, power failure.

**Examples:**

* Blocking key (arrows, x for cross, ↺/↻ for turns, “U/D/L/R/UR…” zones).
* Rehearsal report with **department tags**: [Scenic], [Props], [Costumes], [Audio], [Lighting], [Deck], [FOH].

**Notes:**

* Capture **objective + outcome** for each block; timebox notes to avoid spillover.
* Keep **RF logs** and battery rotations once mics enter rehearsal.

**Checklists:**

* **Room Open Checklist:** spikes, sign-in, water, batteries, first-aid, quiet zones.
* **Daily Plan:** call time, warm-up, goals, work blocks, breaks, wrap-up.
* **Absence/Delay Protocol:** notification steps, escalation path, safety considerations.

### Lesson 6: Show Calls and Performance Management

**Content:**

* **Calling philosophy:** anticipate, **standby stacks**, clear diction, consistent syntax.
* **Cue sheet** anatomy: cue number, page/measure, trigger, action, confirmation, contingencies.
* **Headset discipline:** brevity, departments (LX, SD, Deck, FOH, Rail, Spots, Flys), priority for safety.
* **Pre-show:** safety check, presets, comms check, house status, conductor sync, FOH coordination, last looks.
* **During show:** calling LX/SD/PROJ/FX/fly/spot; monitoring deck traffic; maintaining show report.
* **Post-show:** incident log, reset notes, maintenance tickets, next-day calls, late notes.
* **Emergency procedures:** show stop language, medical, fire, evac—who communicates what and when.

**Examples:**

* **Standby stack** snippet: “Standby Lights 34–36, Sound K–M, Fly 2, Deck shift A.”
* **Call syntax** snippet: “Lights 35… go. Sound K… go. Fly 2… go.”
* **Show report** fields: House in/out, run time, notes per dept, incidents, late calls, audience notes.
* **Show Stop Procedure:** “Attention: we are holding. Please remain seated. We will resume shortly.” Resume: “We are resuming from Page 42 at LX 35 on my ‘Go.’”

**Notes:**

* Rehearse **show stops** and re-starts like any other cue sequence.
* Keep **redundant copies** of cue sheets, stage plots, and emergency procedures at SM desk and deck.
* Headset protocol: comms check at top, priority order (safety > timing > notes), clear channel labeling.
