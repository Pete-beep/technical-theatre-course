# Module 02: Stage Management

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, students will be able to:

* Identify the core responsibilities of a Stage Manager (SM) across plays, musicals, dance, concerts, and devised work.
* Create a pre-production package: contact sheet, production calendar, preliminary rehearsal schedule, stage plot, and paperwork templates.
* Plan and run efficient rehearsals: blocking notation, line notes, rehearsal reports, and communication cadence.
* Prepare and execute show calls: cueing, standby stacks, comms discipline, and performance paperwork.
* Demonstrate professional standards for safety, communication, documentation, and leadership.

## üìñ Key Concepts

* The SM as hub for **communication**, **documentation**, and **coordination**
* Paperwork ecosystems: **who needs what, by when, and in what format**
* **Rehearsal flow**: objectives, timeboxing, and feedback loops
* **Calling a show**: translating designs into actionable cueing
* **Safety & consent**: intimacy, fight, FX, and emergency protocols
* **Stage Plot**: a central diagram showing the layout of scenery, props, actor positions, and technical gear; referenced by multiple departments throughout the production

## üìù Lesson Content

### Lesson 3: The Role of the Stage Manager in Different Performance Types

**Content:**

* **Plays:** smaller cue counts, text-driven; emphasis on script, blocking, props tracking, line notes.
* **Musicals:** music and dance integration; increased cues, complex transitions, more departments (orchestra, audio, RF).
* **Dance/Movement:** choreographic structures over dialogue; cueing off counts, phrases, or conductor; floor pattern tracking.
* **Concerts/Events:** live timing with limited rehearsal; heavy comms, backline/patch logistics, safety around haze/pyro.
* **Devised/Fringe:** evolving scripts; flexible paperwork; rapid version control and daily change logs.
* **Throughlines:** safety leadership, clear comms tree, and decisive time management regardless of genre.

**Examples:**

* Sample **responsibility matrix** comparing Play vs Musical vs Dance (who owns what: props, quick-changes, spikes, mics).
* A one-page **Comms Map** (SM ‚Üí ASM ‚Üí Deck; SM ‚Üî FOH; SM ‚Üî Designers; SM ‚Üî Music Director).

**Notes:**

* When in doubt, **clarify cues‚Äô sources** (visual, musical, conductor, deck-ready).
* Define **authority boundaries** early (e.g., stop authority for safety).

### Lesson 4: Pre-Production Tasks

**Content:**

* Confirm **production timeline**: auditions ‚Üí build ‚Üí tech ‚Üí previews ‚Üí run ‚Üí strike.
* Build the SM **paperwork kit**:

  * Contact sheet, distribution list, pronouns/access needs (if collected).
  * Production calendar with **milestones** and blackout dates.
  * Rehearsal schedule template (objectives + locations + who‚Äôs called).
  * Preliminary **run sheets**, **props lists**, **scene breakdown**, **entrance/exit plots**.
  * **Stage Plot** showing layout of set pieces, props, spike marks, and technical elements (band gear, monitors, mic stands, quick-change zones).
  * Risk register (FX, flying, fog/haze, weaponry, intimacy/fight).
* **Information intake:** read-through notes, design packets, groundplan, score/script versions, mic plot, quick-change zones.
* **Meetings:** design/production meetings‚Äîcapture decisions and action items, circulate minutes within 24 hours.

**Examples:**

* 3-week sample **production calendar** (color-coded departments).
* **Props tracker** (Item, Source, Status, Notes, Preset, Page).
* **Stage Plot** diagram with labels for entrances, exits, set pieces, and technical positions.
* **Version control**: file naming (`Show_Script_v03_2025-10-14.docx`).

**Notes:**

* Lock a **single source of truth** (cloud folder naming + update etiquette).
* Publish **distribution cadence** (e.g., daily rehearsal report by 10pm).
* Ensure the **Stage Plot** is updated as designs evolve; distribute revisions to all departments.

### Lesson 5: Managing Rehearsals

**Content:**

* **Room setup:** groundplan/spikes, first-aid, water, sign-in, silence zones, battery charging, RF etiquette.
* **Flow:** call time, warm-up, goals review, work blocks (50‚Äì80 min), breaks, wrap with next-day call.
* **Documentation:**

  * **Blocking notation** (symbols + actor initials + page references).
  * **Line notes** (omission/addition/paraphrase).
  * **Rehearsal report** (issues, requests, deadlines, safety notes).
  * **Change log** and distribution.
* **People & pacing:** balancing director‚Äôs needs with room morale; escalation path for concerns; consent practices for intimacy/fight.
* **Contingencies:** absent performers, tech delays, injury protocol, power failure.

**Examples:**

* Blocking key (arrows, x for cross, ‚Ü∫/‚Üª for turns, ‚ÄúU/D/L/R/UR‚Ä¶‚Äù zones).
* Rehearsal report with **department tags**: [Scenic], [Props], [Costumes], [Audio], [Lighting], [Deck], [FOH].

**Notes:**

* Capture **objective + outcome** for each block; timebox notes to avoid spillover.
* Keep **RF logs** and battery rotations once mics enter rehearsal.

---

### Lesson 6: Show Calls and Performance Management

**Content:**

* **Calling philosophy:** anticipate, **standby stacks**, clear diction, consistent syntax.
* **Cue sheet** anatomy: cue number, page/measure, trigger, action, confirmation, contingencies.
* **Headset discipline:** brevity, departments (LX, SD, Deck, FOH, Rail, Spots, Flys), priority for safety.
* **Pre-show:** safety check, presets, coms check, house status, conductor sync, FOH coordination, last looks.
* **During show:** calling LX/SD/PROJ/FX/fly/spot; monitoring deck traffic; maintaining show report.
* **Post-show:** incident log, reset notes, maintenance tickets, next-day calls, late notes.
* **Emergency procedures:** show stop language, medical, fire, evac‚Äîwho communicates what and when.

**Examples:**

* **Standby stack** snippet: ‚ÄúStandby Lights 34‚Äì36, Sound K‚ÄìM, Fly 2, Deck shift A.‚Äù
* **Call syntax** snippet: ‚ÄúLights 35‚Ä¶ go. Sound K‚Ä¶ go. Fly 2‚Ä¶ go.‚Äù
* **Show report** fields: House in/out, run time, notes per dept, incidents, late calls, audience notes.

**Notes:**

* Rehearse **show stops** and re-starts like any other cue sequence.
* Keep **redundant copies** of cue sheets, stage plots, and emergency procedures at SM desk and deck.
