## 📝 Lesson Content

### 1. The Role of Backstage Operations
Backstage operations are the invisible engine of a live performance. While the audience never sees this work, every scene change, prop hand-off, and quick change depends on precise timing and coordination. Crew professionalism backstage directly impacts the pacing, safety, and success of the show.

### 2. Backstage Crew Roles
- **Deck Crew** — Moves scenery, presets props, tracks actor entrances, and maintains order.  
- **Fly Crew** — Handles counterweight systems, curtains, drops, and flown scenery.  
- **Props Crew** — Sets, maintains, and tracks all handheld or scenic props.  
- **Wardrobe Crew** — Supports quick changes, repairs, and costume resets.  
- **ASMs (Assistant Stage Managers)** — Supervise backstage zones, give standbys, and coordinate with the Stage Manager (SM).  

Each role is part of a coordinated backstage ecosystem.

### 3. Backstage Etiquette
- **Silence is golden** — Unnecessary noise distracts performers and audience.  
- **Stay in position** — Remain at your assigned post until cleared by the SM or ASM.  
- **All black** — Crew should wear black clothing to remain unseen.  
- **No phones or distractions** — Safety and focus come first.  
- **Headset discipline** — Use clear, concise comms; follow protocol (“Standby… Go”).

### 4. Paperwork & Tools
Backstage work relies on well-designed paperwork:
- **Run Sheets** — Crew-specific task lists (see Appendix: Run Sheet Template).  
- **Props Preset Lists & Tracking Sheets** — Ensure every item is in the right place (Appendix: Props Templates).  
- **Scene Shift Plots** — Who moves what, when, and where (Appendix: Scene Shift Template).  
- **Quick Change Checklists** — Step-by-step guide for successful rapid changes (Appendix: Quick Change Checklist).  
- **Mic Plots** — For managing wireless microphones and RF hand-offs (Appendix: Mic Plot Template).  

### 5. Traffic Flow & Safety
Backstage is a high-traffic environment:
- Plan and rehearse **backstage traffic flow** to prevent collisions (Appendix: Traffic Flow Diagram).  
- Keep pathways clear of props, costumes, and personal items.  
- Always maintain **emergency egress routes**.  
- Regularly check spike marks, glow tape, and running lights.  
- Use the **Backstage Safety Walkthrough** checklist before every show.  

### 6. Emergencies & Show Stops
- Follow the Stage Manager’s lead for all holds and stops.  
- Know your **emergency action checklist** (fire, injury, technical failure).  
- Never improvise in an emergency — stick to established protocols.  
- Always put safety before the performance.
