# Course Style Guide

**Goal:** Keep the entire course consistent in structure, tone, and formatting.

## 1) File & Naming
- Lessons: `modules/NN-short-title.md` (e.g., `02-lighting-basics.md`)
- Images: `assets/images/NN-short-title-##.png`
- Slides: `assets/slides/NN-short-title.pdf`

## 2) Markdown Structure
- H1 `#` — Lesson title
- H2 `##` — Section headings (Objectives, Key Concepts, Content, Activity, Summary, References)
- Lists use `-` for bullets; `1.` for steps
- Code blocks: triple backticks with language (e.g., ```powershell)

## 3) Learning Objectives
- Start with “Students will be able to …”
- Keep 2–5 objectives per lesson

## 4) Tone & Voice
- Clear, direct, supportive. Avoid passive voice when possible.
- Use inclusive language.

## 5) Images & Media
- Use descriptive alt text.
- Store all media under `assets/` and reference relatively.

## 6) Assessment & Activities
- Include expected outcomes or solution sketches.
- Add reflection prompts (What went well? What would you improve?)

## 7) Versioning
- Commit messages: `[module NN] brief change description`
- Keep changes focused; open an Issue for larger ideas.
