# Course Style Guide v3

This style guide defines the structure, tone, and conventions for all modules in the *Technical Theatre Course*. It updates v2 with refinements from recent module development.

---

## 🎯 Module Structure

Each module should follow this order:

1. **🎯 Learning Objectives** — 4–6 outcomes written as *students will be able to…*
2. **📖 Key Concepts** — 4–6 high-level ideas.
3. **📖 Key Terms (Quick Reference)** — short definitions of new or recurring jargon.
4. **📝 Lesson Content** — divided into numbered lessons (Lesson 1, 2, etc.), each with:

   * **Content**: core explanations.
   * **Examples**: concrete illustrations, diagrams, or scenarios.
   * **Notes**: reminders, cautions, or professional practice insights.
   * **Optional Checklists**: step-by-step procedures where useful.
5. **🎬 Activities / Exercises** — hands-on tasks. Each must include:

   * **Task**: what the student must do.
   * **Deliverable**: what to submit.
   * **Rubric**: grading criteria with weighted categories.
6. **✅ Summary** — 4–6 bullet takeaways.
7. **📚 References & Resources** — templates, guides, and recommended reading.

---

## 📖 Key Terms

* Include a **Key Terms (Quick Reference)** section in any module where new vocabulary is introduced.
* Keep definitions **short, clear, and student-friendly**.
* Terms should also exist in the central **Glossary (Module 00)**, but the quick reference ensures immediate clarity.

---

## 📋 Checklists & Protocols

* Modules may include **checklists** inside lessons (e.g., Room Open Checklist, Absence/Delay Protocol).
* Use concise, actionable steps; 5–7 bullets is ideal.
* Format: **Checklist name** in bold, bullets below.

---

## 📝 Activities & Rubrics

* All activities must state:

  * **Task**
  * **Deliverable**
  * **Rubric** (accuracy, clarity, professionalism, etc.)
* Rubrics should total 100 points; use 3–5 categories with weights.
* This ensures transparent assessment and consistent expectations.

---

## 🔗 Cross-Links to Appendix

* Modules should **reference the Appendix** for detailed forms, templates, or diagrams.
* Use phrasing such as: *“See Appendix: Rehearsal Report Template.”*
* Do not embed full documents inside modules.

---

## 📏 Naming Consistency

* Use **Show Report** consistently across modules.
* The Appendix may note alternate labels (e.g., “Performance Report”), but module text should be unified.

---

## ♿ Accessibility & Inclusion

* All modules must flag **inclusion and accessibility considerations** where relevant:

  * Quiet spaces in rehearsal rooms.
  * Pronouns and access needs (privacy respected).
  * Sensory warnings (strobe, haze, FX).
  * ADA/accessible pathways in stage plots.

---

## 🗂 Single Source of Truth (SSoT)

* Modules that involve paperwork must reinforce:

  * **File naming conventions**.
  * **Version control** practices.
  * **Single source of truth (SSoT)**: if it isn’t in the prompt book or official folder, it isn’t official.
* Encourage distribution cadences (e.g., daily rehearsal report by 10pm).

---

## 🎨 Tone & Style

* Use a **professional but approachable tone**.
* Favor **clear, direct sentences** over academic complexity.
* Use **emoji headers** consistently for navigation and student engagement.
* Keep modules between **6–12 pages** when expanded to PDF with examples.
